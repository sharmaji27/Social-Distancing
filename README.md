# Social-Distancing  
1. This project is made to monitor if Social Distancing is being followed in a locality or not.  
2. I have used the YOLO architecture based on darknet to build this project.  
3. You must have CUDA enabled OPENCV to use it as it is otherwise just comment out lines 9 and 10 and you are good to go.  
4. You can also see a counter on the bottom left corner indicating the number of violations in the frame.  
5. One can also use it on a webcam just by tweaking a single change in line 14 --> cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0).  

Download yolov3.weights file from here and paste it in the master folder with cfg file --> https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?export=download&confirm=phEB&id=1I92QB0ifKoEOZcUq6gAfay-o4Tjw1xTU  

PS -> We could have used 3D projections (3D distances) between the two people, but that would have become very complex for freshers to understand. That's why we have gone with 2D distances only in this project.
